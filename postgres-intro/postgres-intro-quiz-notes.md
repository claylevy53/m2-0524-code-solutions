Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- Why do we use databases in Web development?

Databases are used in web development to store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently. They provide a structured way to handle large amounts of data, support data integrity, enable complex queries, and allow multiple users to interact with the data simultaneously.

PostgreSQL is an open-source, powerful relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its robustness, scalability, and compliance with SQL standards. Some alternative relational databases include MySQL, SQLite, Oracle Database, and Microsoft SQL Server.

- What are some advantages of learning a relational database?

Structured Data Management: Relational databases use structured query language (SQL) to manage data in tables, making it easier to organize and query data.

Data Integrity: They ensure data accuracy and consistency through constraints and transactions.

Scalability: Relational databases can handle large amounts of data and high transaction volumes.

Industry Demand: Knowledge of relational databases is a highly valued skill in the tech industry.

Flexibility: They support complex queries, joins, and data relationships.

- What is one way to see if PostgreSQL is running?

One way to check if PostgreSQL is running is by using the command line. You can run the command sudo service postgresql status.
