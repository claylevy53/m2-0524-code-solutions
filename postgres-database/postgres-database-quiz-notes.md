## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a database schema?

A database schema is a blueprint or architecture of a database that defines how data is organized and structured. It includes the definitions of tables, columns, data types, relationships, indexes, constraints, and other elements. The schema serves as a guide for how the data is stored, organized, and accessed.

- What is a table?

A table is a collection of related data entries organized in rows and columns within a database. Each table represents a specific entity or concept, such as customers, orders, or products. Tables are the fundamental building blocks of a relational database.

- What is a row?

A row, also known as a record or tuple, is a single, horizontal entry in a table that contains data for a specific instance of the entity described by the table. Each row consists of multiple values, each corresponding to a different attribute (column) of the table.

- What is an attribute and what other names are used to describe them?

An attribute, also known as a column or field, is a single piece of data that describes a property of the entity represented by the table. Each attribute has a specific data type, such as integer, string, or date, and defines the kind of data that can be stored in that column. Attributes are the vertical components of a table, and they help define the structure and meaning of the data.
